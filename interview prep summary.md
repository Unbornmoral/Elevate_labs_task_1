INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

WHAT IS SEMANTIC HTML
Semantic html is like giving your code meaning. Instead of using <div> for everything, you use tags like <header>, <nav>, or <footer> so it’s clear what each part of the page is for. It’s better for accessibility and makes your code easier to read — for both humans and search engines.

HOW DOES CSS FLEXBOX DIFFER FROM GRID
Flexbox vs Grid Flexbox is great when you’re lining things up in one direction — like a row of buttons or a vertical list. Grid is your go-to when you need full control over rows and columns, like laying out a dashboard or a photo gallery.

WHAT ARE MEDIA QUERIES
Media Queries are your “if screen is small, do this” rules. They let you tweak your layout depending on the device — so your site doesn’t look like a squished mess on a phone.

HOW DO YOU MAKE A WEBSITE RESPONSIVE
Responsive Design Is all about making your site look good everywhere — phones, tablets, laptops. You use flexible layouts, media queries, and relative units like % or em so things scale nicely.

EXPLAIN BOX MODEL
Box Model Every element is basically a box. Inside is your content, then padding (space inside the box), then the border, then margin (space outside the box). Once you get this, spacing stuff becomes way easier.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CLASSES AND IDs IN CSS
Classes vs IDs Classes are like outfits you can reuse — multiple elements can wear the same style. IDs are one-of-a-kind — only one element should have a specific ID. Use classes for styling, IDs for targeting something specific (like with JavaScript).

HOW CAN YOU OPTIMIZE CSS FOR PERFORMANCE
Optimizing CSS Keeps the work clean. Don’t write styles you don’t use. Combine similar rules. Use shorthand when you can. And if you’re shipping a site, minify your CSS so it loads faster.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REALTIVE AND ABSOLUTE POSITIONING
Relative means “move this a bit from where it normally sits.” Absolute means “put this exactly here,” based on its nearest positioned parent. Absolute can be powerful but also tricky — it can break layouts if you’re not careful.

HOW DOES THE Z-INDEX PROPERTY WORK
z-index This decides what sits on top. Higher number = closer to the front. Super useful for things like modals, dropdowns, or overlapping elements.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERNCE BETWEEN PADDING AND MARGIN
Padding vs Margin Padding is the space inside the box — it pushes the content inward. Margin is the space outside the box — it pushes other elements away. They’re both about spacing, just in different directions.
