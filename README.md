## 🚀 Simple Responsive Landing Page

### 📄 About the Project
This is a clean, responsive landing page built using **HTML5** and **CSS3** as part of a web development internship task. The page includes a header, hero section, and footer — all styled for modern devices using Flexbox and media queries.

### 🎯 Objectives Covered
- ✅ Built with semantic HTML structure
- ✅ Styled using external CSS
- ✅ Header includes logo and navigation links
- ✅ Hero section features a headline, paragraph, and call-to-action button
- ✅ Footer includes social media links
- ✅ Layout uses Flexbox for alignment and spacing
- ✅ Media queries ensure responsiveness across screen sizes

### 🛠 Tools Used
- Visual Studio Code
- Chrome Browser
- Live Server Extension

### 📱 Responsive Design
The layout adapts to different screen sizes. On smaller screens, navigation collapses and elements stack vertically for better readability.

### 📁 Files Included
- `index.html` — main HTML structure
- `styles.css` — styling and layout rules

### 👀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo or download the files.
2. Open the folder in VS Code.
3. Right-click `index.html` and choose **"Open with Live Server"**.
4. Resize your browser window to test responsiveness.
